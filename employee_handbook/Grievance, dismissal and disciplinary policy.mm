      The Company&#8217;s aim is to resolve any grievance a member of staff may have about their employment as quickly and effectively as possible. Most grievances can be settled informally and employees should aim to settle their grievances in this way if possible.

      If an employee has a grievance they should always discuss the matter initially with their immediate Manager who, in most cases, can best respond to any complaint. If the grievance actually concerns their Manager, then they should approach another senior member of staff, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Every effort will be made to resolve the matter through informal discussions.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      If the solutions suggested are unacceptable, then the employee should use the statutory procedure to raise a formal grievance.

      Our staff represent a significant investment and every effort will be made to correct shortcomings through offering advice and encouragement before resorting to disciplinary measures. In the interests of fairness and consistency, however, it is necessary to have formal disciplinary procedures in place for dealing with more serious matters.

      Minor problems can often be dealt with most effectively through informal counselling and advice and the Company will always consider this option before pursuing disciplinary action.These sessions are sometimes referred to as 'informal warnings' and the employee will be made aware that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          the session has been arranged because the Company is concerned about their performance or conduct;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
          the Company will be looking for an improvement within a reasonable timescale, otherwise formal disciplinary action may be taken
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Informal counselling will normally be handled by the person to whom the employee reports.

    <p>
      Where the gravity of the problem makes an informal approach inappropriate - either because of the nature of the alleged offence, or where previous counselling has failed to achieve the necessary improvement - the matter will be pursued through the formal disciplinary procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      
    </p>
    <p>
      At all stages of the procedure, an investigation will be carried out. Your Manager will establish the facts as quickly as possible, taking into account any available statements from witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company will notify the employee in writing of the allegations against him or her and will invite the employee to a disciplinary hearing to discuss the matter. The employee must take all reasonable steps to attend that meeting. Following the meeting, the employee will be informed in writing of the Company&#8217;s decision in accordance with the stages set out below and notified of his or her right to appeal against that decision.
    </p>

      The employee will be given a formal Written Warning. He or she will be advised of the reason for the warning, how they need to improve their conduct or performance, the timescale over which the improvement is to be achieved and that the warning is the first stage of the formal disciplinary procedure. The employee will also be told that failure to improve could lead to a final written warning and, ultimately, dismissal.

    <p>
      Failure to improve performance in response to the procedure so far, a repeat of misconduct for which a warning has previously been issued, or a first instance of serious misconduct or serious poor performance, will result in a Final Written Warning being issued &#8211; but only after the employee has been given the chance to present their case at a meeting. The Final Written Warning will give details of, and grounds for, the complaint, how he or she needs to improve their conduct or performance, the timescale over which the improvement is to be achieved and warn that dismissal will probably result if the terms of the warning are not complied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Warnings will not normally remain in force indefinitely but will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after a specified period of satisfactory conduct. The time limit set will depend on the nature and gravity of the offence and on the employee's past disciplinary record. Warnings will normally remain on file for 6 months for a Written Warning and 12 months for a Final Written Warning. However, if the misconduct is particularly serious, a Final Written Warning will not be removed from the record.

A decision of this kind will only be made after the fullest possible investigation. Dismissal can only be authorised by the Managing Director. The employee will be informed of the reasons for dismissal, the appropriate period of notice, the date on which his or her employment will terminate and how he/she can appeal against the dismissal decision.

      Gross misconduct is behaviour - either during or outside working hours - which renders undesirable an employee's continued employment by the Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      
    </p>
    <p>
      If an employee is accused of an act of gross misconduct, he/she may be suspended from work on full pay, normally for no more than five working days, whilst the alleged offence is fully investigated. If, on completion of the investigation and the full disciplinary procedure, the Company is satisfied that gross misconduct has occurred, the result will normally be summary dismissal without notice or payment in lieu of notice.

      <font size="3">An employee may appeal against any disciplinary decision, including dismissal, to the Managing Director within five working days of the decision. Appeals should be made in writing and state the grounds for appeal. The employee will be invited to attend an appeal hearing chaired by the Managing Director. At the appeal hearing, the employee will again be given the chance to state his or her case and will have the right to be accompanied by a fellow employee of his or her choice or a trade union representative. Following the appeal hearing, the employee will be informed of the appeal decision, and the reasons for it, in writing.</font>
